# Named Entity Recognition
This BERT model aims to accurately perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, using the CONLL-2003 dataset from HuggingFace, and achieves this using basic deep learning and natural language processing practices and the power of PyTorch.

The BERT model used (which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), is based on the popular transformer architecture, and is highly suited for multiple natural language tasks.
